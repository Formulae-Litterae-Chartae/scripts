To remove a user:

Do [1]-[5] above
Then:

users = User.query.all()
for u in users: 
    print(u.id, u.username, u.project_team)
# Use this user information to decide which user id(s) should be deleted
to_delete = User.query.get(int(<ID>))
db.session.delete(to_delete)
# Repeat this for all the user accounts you want to delete
# Then check to make sure the accounts have been deleted and no other accounts were accidentally deleted with:
users = User.query.all()
for u in users: 
    print(u.id, u.username, u.project_team)
# Once you are satisfied with the results, commit the session:
db.session.commit()
