When adding new Elex files:

- Add the new entries into "Begriffe_eLexikon.xml" in this folder
- Run "add_new_lemmaRefs.py" in this folder to add references to the entries into the formulae files
- Run "create_formulae_elex_mapping.py" in this folder to create the json mapping file that will be used to add the inRefs to the elex metadata files
- Now follow the rest of the instructions in "elexicon_conversion.txt"
